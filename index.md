## About Me

I am a research fellow at [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), with Prof. [Yiping Ke](https://keyiping.wixsite.com/index). Previously, I defended my Ph.D. in CCDS at NTU in 2024. 
Prior to NTU, I received a B.S. in Software Engineering from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn) in 2020. I worked with Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) on Natural Language Processing. 

## Research Interests

- **Graph Representation Learning:** graph classification, out-of-distribution generalization, expressiveness of GNNs
- **Brain Network Analysis:** fMRI, multi-modal brain networks, neurodegenerative disorders

My PhD thesis made some early attempts on these problems. I do believe these fields make invaluable contributions to the real world. Meanwhile, I am always open for collaborations and communications. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email.

## Miscellaneous

Aside from my curiosity about computer science and my study preoccupation, I am also a big fan of music and go game. I would like to listen to the concert, play guitar or watch go game competition in my free time. If this involves sports, I favor swimming since it enhances my self-control and it is a benefit in my health insurance and spirit.
