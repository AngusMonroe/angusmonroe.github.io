## About Me

I am a research fellow at [Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), with Prof. [Mengling Feng](https://www.mornin-feng.com/). Previously, I defended my Ph.D. in [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in 2025. 
Prior to NTU, I received a B.S. in Software Engineering from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn) in 2020. 

## Research Interests

- **Graph Representation Learning:** graph classification, out-of-distribution generalization, expressiveness of GNNs
- **Brain Network Analysis:** fMRI, multi-modal brain networks, neurodegenerative disorders

My PhD thesis made some early attempts on these problems. I do believe these fields make invaluable contributions to the real world. Meanwhile, I am always open for collaborations and communications. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to drop me an email.

## Miscellaneous

Aside from my curiosity about computer science and my study preoccupation, I am also a big fan of music and Weiqi. I would like to listen to the concert or watch Weiqi competition in my free time. If this involves sports, I favor swimming since it enhances my self-control and it is a benefit in my health insurance and spirit.
